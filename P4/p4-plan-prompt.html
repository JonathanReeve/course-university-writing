Op-ed
</p>

<p>
Write an op-ed on a topic of your choosing that has currency and relevance for your intended audience. Make it your best piece of writing ever. Use all the relevant techniques you've learned from P1-P3. Make a specific <b>claim</b> about your topic, and make sure you have a clear <b>motive</b>. Tailor your op-ed to your target publication. Unless your publication has a house style (Chicago, APA, NYT, etc.), use MLA format, and unless your publication requires a specific word length, make your op-ed about 750 words. 
</p>
