Conversation Essay
</p>

<p>
Choose <b>two</b> texts from among the Tenen, Shannon, Silver, Stephens-Davidowitz, and Gelman readings. Choose passages in each that answer, contradict, complement, or expand upon one another. <b>Synthesize</b> a <b>claim</b> about these two texts that puts them in conversation, and support this claim using <b>textual evidence</b>. The paper should be 1500-2000 words long.  
</p>

<p>
Goals: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify a central <b>problem</b>, present in both of your texts, that is worth addressing.</li>
<li>Formulate a <b>claim</b> about these two texts that makes a strong argument and is not obvious.</li>
<li>Establish a <b>motive</b> for the essay in your <b>introduction</b>. Here you will answer the “So What?” question, suggesting why your essay is important and interesting to an intelligent reader. Draw out the implications of the argument in your <b>conclusion</b>.</li>
<li><b>Structure</b> the essay around your central claim, making sure that each paragraph is adding an essential piece to your argument.</li>
<li>Use <b>evidence</b> persuasively, quoting from the texts, summarizing or paraphrasing accurately and responsibly when appropriate. Do not provide evidence from other sources or make general assertions (e.g., claims about “human nature”).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Write a partial draft of three pages that includes at least two pages of polished prose. The unpolished sections of the partial draft can take the form of an outline or notes, though the general shape and argument of your paper should be apparent. Continue to think about the central <b>problem</b> that you are exploring. Is the problem resolved? Is the resolution (or absence of resolution) significant to the argument? Think about the <b>motive</b> of your <b>claim</b>. How does your claim and analysis help us to understand the texts' ideas in a new way?
</p>

<p>
As with all written work in this class, ensure that your draft adheres to MLA style, including in-text citations for each quotation, and a Works Cited page containing entries for each citation. Post it to CourseWorks as a PDF file.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
Make your formal draft as polished as possible. Think of it as a final draft. The better this draft is, the better your actual final draft will be. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As with your exploratory draft, ensure that this draft adheres to MLA style, including in-text citations and a Works Cited page.</li>
<li>Edit your draft thoroughly before submitting it. Tighten wordy sentences, choose specific verbs, and clarify vague constructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your final draft should be a <b>radical</b> rewrite of your essay, taking into account instructor and peer feedback, but not merely responding to it. In other words, instead of correcting the occasional misspelled word, or tightening a few wordy sentences, make substantial and well-considered improvements to the structure and syntax or your essay. Post your final paper to the assignments section on CourseWorks.
